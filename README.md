# Gesture Driven LED Matrix Fusion
 The Gesture Matrix system comprises two pivotal components: the sensor board and the display board. The sensor board hosts both gyroscope and accelerometer sensors, functioning collaboratively to detect hand motions. Meanwhile, on the display board, a 4x4 LED matrix dynamically responds to these gestures, orchestrating the movement of a single LED across its grid to mirror the detected hand movements. This seamless interaction between the sensor and display boards is orchestrated through a robust Bluetooth communication interface, enabling real-time data transfer and synchronized LED responses to detect gestures.
